# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Run

To run the game, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How to Play

The game starts immediately when you load the page. The snake moves in the direction of the arrow keys. The goal of the game is to eat as many apples as possible without colliding with the snake's own body.

Each time the snake eats an apple, it grows longer and the game speed increases. The game ends when the snake collides with its own body.

## Game Structure

The game is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the basic structure of the game, including a canvas element where the game is drawn.

- `js/script.js`: This is the main JavaScript file for the game. It contains the game logic, including the Snake class and the game loop. The Snake class has properties like length and direction, and methods like move and eat. The game loop handles the game state and renders the game on the canvas.

- `css/style.css`: This is the CSS file for the game. It contains the styles for the game, including the styles for the canvas and the snake.

Enjoy the game!
